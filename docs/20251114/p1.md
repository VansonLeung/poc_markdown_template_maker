I need an HTML WYSIWYG editor:

the interface should support:
a comprehensive HTML editor using "contenteditable"
adding rows
adding columns
adding tables
editing tables content
editing tables rows cols
editing tables row-col width/height
adding layout flexboxes
editing layout flexboxes properties very easily
edit typography
edit color and background color
make it very interactive, WYSIWYG, intuitive and absolutely great at look & feel
make it able to highlight elements
make it able to recognize cursor highlights to show floating toolboxes on top or bottom or side of the cursor / highlights
raise clarifications e.g. what framework, responsiveness, look and feel, etc



I'll help you create an HTML WYSIWYG editor! Before I start building, let me clarify a few important details to ensure I create exactly what you need:

Framework & Technology Stack
JavaScript Framework: Would you prefer:

Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)
React
Vue
Svelte
Other?
CSS Framework/Styling: Would you like:

Plain CSS/Tailwind CSS
Bootstrap
Material UI
Custom CSS with modern design system
Other?
Design & User Experience
Look & Feel: What aesthetic are you targeting?

Modern/Minimalist (like Notion, Google Docs)
Professional/Corporate (like Microsoft Office)
Creative/Colorful (like Canva)
Dark mode support?
Toolbar Style: Where should the editing tools appear?

Fixed toolbar at top (like classic editors)
Floating/contextual toolbars that appear near selection (like Medium, Notion)
Sidebar panels
Combination of above?
Functionality Scope
Responsiveness:

Should the editor itself be responsive (work on mobile/tablet)?
Should it allow creating responsive layouts (with breakpoint controls)?
Output Format:

Should it export clean HTML?
Need to save/load templates?
JSON representation of the content?
Table Features Priority:

Merge/split cells?
Cell styling (borders, padding, colors)?
Resize by dragging?
Flexbox Layout:

Visual controls for flex properties (justify, align, direction, wrap)?
Drag-and-drop to rearrange flex items?
Preset layout templates?
Additional Features
Advanced Features (nice-to-have):
Undo/redo?
Copy/paste formatting?
Image upload support?
Code view (HTML source)?
Mobile-first vs desktop-first approach?
My Recommendation: If you want me to proceed with sensible defaults, I'd suggest:

Vanilla JavaScript (or React if you prefer) for maximum flexibility
Tailwind CSS for modern, clean UI with custom components
Floating contextual toolbars like Notion/Medium for intuitive UX
Desktop-first with responsive output capability
Modern minimalist design with clean icons and smooth interactions
Should I proceed with these defaults, or would you like to specify different choices?
