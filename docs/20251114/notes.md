furthermore - i want to make it support:

•⁠  ⁠saving these HTMLs as templates
•⁠  ⁠⁠support adding special tags in the template
•⁠  ⁠⁠an API for LLM have access to these templates (i.e. the LLM just needs to specifically design some parts - not the whole HTML)
•⁠  ⁠⁠an API for LLM to create / edit the derivatives of the template (i.e. the server helps the LLM save their editing)
•⁠  ⁠⁠an API for LLM to represent the resulting product HTML (the HTMLs are rendered by the server, the server serves the resulting HTML)

By the method above , I don’t need to rely on using Claude Code, and I can make any LLM able to “make” and "host" HTMLs without Claude Code
